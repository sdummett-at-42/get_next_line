# Welcome to get_next_line 👋

> The aim of this project is to create a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

## Usage

Just compile the *.c/*.h or the *_bonus.c/*_bonus.h files, the *_bonus.c/*_bonus.h can handle multiple fd instead of one.
```

## Run tests

```sh
clang main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
clang main.c get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c
```
